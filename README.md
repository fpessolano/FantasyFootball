**Description**  
This is a python3 project of a father and a son to try to teach python.  
It is a text-base football manager game.  

**Usage**  
Just execute main,.py  

**Known BUGS**  
1. The scheduling function is only partially completed as it misses backstepping in its algorithm.  
As a result it takes too long for more than 16 teams and this has been set as maximum number of teams (temporarily).  

**What's next**  
 - Save and load a game  
 - Support for randomised leagues from existing teams (provided as a file)  
 - A more realistic (probabilistic) algorithm using player statistics for determining the match result  
 - A trained neural network to calculate the match result  
 - More than one league  
 - Proper commenting
