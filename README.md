**Description**  
This is a python project used to try and teach python to ym son in a fun way and with increasing difficulty.  
It is meant to be a simple text-base football manager game.  

**Usage**  
Just run "python3 main.py" after having installed the required modules (see requirements.txt)  

**Known BUGS**  
1. The scheduling algorithm is partially implemented. As a result it takes too long for more than 16 teams and this has been set as maximum number of teams (temporarily).  

**What's next**  
 - Complete scheduling for any number of teams.  
 - Proper commenting  
 - A more realistic (probabilistic) algorithm using player statistics for determining the match result  
 - Support for randomised leagues from existing teams (provided as a file)  
 - More than one league  
 - A trained neural network to calculate the match result
