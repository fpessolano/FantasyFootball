## Dependencies  
See `requirements.txt`  

## Usage  

### Quick Start
```bash
# Modern entry point (recommended)
python run.py

# Legacy entry point (backward compatibility)
python main.py
```

Both entry points now use the same modular architecture and provide identical functionality.

### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project now uses a modular architecture for better maintainability:
