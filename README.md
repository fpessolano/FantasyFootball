# Fantasy Football Manager  
**About:**      A CLI football manager game in Python3  
**Author:**     F. Pessolano  
**Version:**    0.6.0

## Description  
A comprehensive football manager simulation application built using both AI and traditional programming approaches. This project aims to create a realistic football management experience with advanced match simulation, player statistics, team management, and strategic gameplay elements.

The application combines modern AI techniques for realistic player behavior and match outcomes with traditional algorithms for core game mechanics, creating an engaging and sophisticated football management simulation.   

## Vision & Goals
This project aims to build a complete football manager simulation that rivals commercial applications by leveraging:

- **AI-Powered Match Engine**: Realistic match outcomes using machine learning and statistical models
- **Intelligent Player Development**: AI-driven player progression and regression systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: Performance prediction and tactical analysis using data science
- **Dynamic Market System**: AI-controlled transfer market with realistic valuations
- **Adaptive Opponent AI**: Computer-controlled teams that learn and adapt strategies

## Current Features
- **League Management**: Create custom leagues, use existing real-world leagues, or generate random leagues
- **Team Management**: Manage your chosen team through seasons with ELO-based ratings
- **Enhanced Match Simulation**: Realistic match outcomes with proper draw probabilities and form consideration
- **Season Play**: Complete seasons with promotion/relegation system
- **Persistent Data**: Save/load system with user profiles and game state management
- **Real World Data**: Over 80 real-world leagues with authentic team data and statistics

## Recent Improvements (v0.6.0)
- **Enhanced Match Engine**: Completely redesigned simulation for realistic results
- **Better Error Handling**: Robust error management throughout the application  
- **Improved UI**: Enhanced screen utilities with better color support
- **Input Validation**: Consistent user input handling with automatic retry
- **Code Quality**: Replaced bare exceptions with specific error handling
